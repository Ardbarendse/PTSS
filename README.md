This project is for digitising the tests of fire pumps. It takes 4 values from a loop current input 4-20mA. These values represent NP flow and pressure, and HP flow and pressure.
The values are then published to a website on a wifi hotspot where they can be picked up for logging the test values.

The software is written in Visual Studio with Platformio.

Hardware is a unit based on an ESP32 processor and Adafruit_ADS1115 ADC.
